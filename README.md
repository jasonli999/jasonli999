"Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet" - Stephen Hawking

Hi, I’m Jason
I'm currently a Physics student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
I would really consider myself a dreamer, a dreamer for a better future for us as a species. Because of this, I'm really passionate and curious about clean energy & solid-state physics and I hope to help combat the world's problems.
